\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Kalman Filter - Overview}

 \textbf{Kalman filtering} is an algorithm that takes a series of measurements over time, containing statistical noise, and produce an estimate that tends to be more accurate than a single measurement. This is very important, because the the sensors give us noisy information or the environment could makes data collection difficult, and the predictions made using kalman filtering help or make a better estimate.  There are many application of the kalman filtering, and in this case, it was used to track a simulated trip of a spaceship from the Earth to the Moon.

\subsection{Kalman Filter - Algorithm}

The Kalman filter for tracking moving objects estimates a state vector, $s_k$ comprising the parameters of the target, such as position, velocity and acceleration, based on a dynamic/measurement mode.

The algorithm of Kalman filtering  consists of two phases: \textbf{update} and \textbf{estimation}. It was assumed that the upper "-" on the vectors and matrices denotes: "before the acquisition of the k-th measure".

\begin{enumerate}
  
  \item \textbf{Update: } First, it is necessary to acquire the new measure $ \boldsymbol{m_k} $, which is modeled as $$m_k = Hs_k + r_k$$ 
  where \textbf{H} is the \textit{ M x N measurement matrix}, and $ \boldsymbol{r_k}$ is \textit{the measurement noise} with the \textit{M x M   measurement noise covariance matrix} \textbf{R}.
  Then, it is possible to compute the \textbf{Kalman Gain}, $\boldsymbol{K_k}$ that minimizes the error of the estimates: $$K_k = P^-_k H^T(HP_k^- H^T + R )^{-1}$$.
  Now it is possible update the state $\hat{s_k}$: $$ \hat{s_k} = \hat{s_k}^- + K_k(m_k - \hat{s_k}^-) $$ and the and the covariance $P_k$ $$ P_k = (I - K_kH)P_k^-$$
  In which \textbf{P} is the \textit{ N x N Posterior covariance matrix}.
  The state $\hat{s}_k $ is a weighted average between $\hat{s}^-_k$, that is the state estimate at time k before to acquire the k-th measurement, and the innovation $m_k - H\hat{s}_k$. The optimal weight, the Kalman gain marix, is obtained by minimising the trace of the covariance matrix.
  
  \item \textbf{Estimation: } Now it is possible o make the two estimations: the state estimate projection $$ \hat{s}^-_{k+1} = \Phi \hat{s_k}$$ and the covariance estimate projection $$\hat{P}^-_{k+1} = \Phi P_k \Phi^T + Q$$
  where  $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ is the \textit{transition matrix}, which allows to pass from the state k to the state k+1, and \textbf{Q} is the \textit{covariance matrix of the process noise}, that allows some variability in the model.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data}

In order to build a simulation of a trajectory from the Earth to the Moon, has been generated synthetic data, o build "toy" trajectory from the Earth to the Moon.
The kalman filter model is a \textit{constant acceleration (CA)} model, in fact, in order to model the kalman filter, has been assumed that the spaceship has a uniformly accelerated motion. But, in order to build a trajectory, that it may remotely resemble to a trip from the Earth to the Moon, it was necessary add the acceleration and other factors to generate the data.
The data are generated in a 3-dimensional space, so, at the end of the generation, the data are composed by the three coordinates of the position (x, y, z), the velocities of the spaceship in the 3 directions (vx, vy, vz) and also the acceleration in the 3 directions (ax, ay, az).
Then, in order to simulate measurements obtained by a sensor, it was necessary add noise to the data.
The Fig \ref{fig:trajectory} shows the results of the data generation. As mentioned before, the measurements simulate a sensor that provides measures with uncertainty, and this measures are represented with a scatter plot.

\section{Methods}

Now it's possible to model kalman filter in order to track the spaceship from the Earth to the moon.
The Kalman Filter algorithm has not been implemented from scratch, but has been used the algorithm provided by the module \textbf{filterpy}.
First it was necessary to initialize  the matrices $\Phi$, H, P, R, Q and to define the state and, as mentioned before, it was assumed that the model is uniformly accelerated. The dynamics of a moving object in one-dimension can be described as follows:

\begin{equation}
    x_t = \frac{1}{2}\Ddot{x} \Delta t^2 + \dot{x}_{t-1} \Delta t + x_{t-1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \dot{x}_t = \Ddot{x} \Delta t + \dot{x}_{t-1}
\end{equation}

and since the motion is uniformly accelerated:

\begin{equation}
    \Ddot{x}_t = \ddot{x}_{t-1}
\end{equation}

In which $ x, \dot{x}, \Ddot{x}$ denote respectively the position, the velocity and the acceleration at time t.So, the dynamics of a moving object in one-dimension can be modeled by the position and the Ô¨Årst derivation of it. Now, this notation can extended for a 3D object, that is described by   $ x, y, z $ for the position, $\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{z} $, for the velocity, and $\Ddot{x}, \Ddot{y}, \Ddot{z}$ for the acceleration.
So, for the 3D object, the state vector
\begin{equation}
s_t = \begin{bmatrix}
             x & y & z & \dot{x} & \dot{y} & \dot{z} & \ddot{x} & \ddot{y} &\ddot{z}
         \end{bmatrix}^T
\end{equation}

Hence, with this assumptions the transition matrix $\Phi$ can be defined as the following 9x9 matrix:

\begin{equation}
    \Phi =  \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & \Delta t & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \Delta t^2 & 0 & 0\\
        0 & 1 & 0 &    0  & \Delta t & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \Delta t^2 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 1 &    0  &   0 & \Delta t & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \Delta t^2\\
        0 & 0 & 0 &    1  &   0 &     0 & \Delta t  & 0 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 0 &    0  &   1 &     0 &  0  & \Delta t &  0\\
        0 & 0 & 0 &    0  &   0 &     1 &  0 & 0 &  \Delta t\\
        0 & 0 & 0 &    0  &   0 &      0 &   1 & 0 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 0 &    0  &   0 &      0 &   0 & 1 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 0 &    0  &   0 &      0 &   0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Since the aim of this project is to track the position of the spaceship, x, y, and z, the measurement matrix 9 x 3, H will be:

\begin{equation}
    H = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Then the process noise Q must to be set in order o achieve tracking errors that are as small as possible. In the conventional tracking systems, the most commonly process noise matrix used is the \textit{random acceleration (RA)} process noise, which is often selected because it has a better performance. The 9x9 random acceleration process noise matrix is defined as following:

\begin{equation}
   Q = GG^T \sigma^2_a
\end{equation}

in which $\sigma^2_a$ is the noise of the acceleration, and G, for a constant acceleration, model is:

\begin{equation}
    G = \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{1}{2} \Delta t & \frac{1}{2} \Delta t & \frac{1}{2} \Delta t & \Delta t & \Delta t & \Delta t & 1 & 1 & 1 
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
 
 Finally, the matrix P can be set to random values, instead R, can be empirically carried out.
